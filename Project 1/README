# Damped Harmonic Oscillator Numerical Methods

## Description
This project implements various numerical integration methods to solve the damped harmonic oscillator, comparing them against exact solutions for different damping regimes: underdamped, critically damped, and overdamped. The methods used include Euler's method, the Runge-Kutta 4th order method (RK4), and SciPy's ODE solver.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- SciPy

You can install the required packages using pip:

```
pip install numpy matplotlib scipy
```

## Usage
Run the `Run_ODE.py` script to visualize the results of the damped harmonic oscillator and to compare the absolute differences between the exact solutions and numerical methods.

```bash
python Run_ODE.py
```

4. Run the `Run_integrals.py` script to perform numerical integration on the Gaussian function and compare the results of various numerical methods against the exact solution.

```bash
python Run_integrals.py
```

5. The generated figures will be saved in the current directory for inclusion in reports or documentation.
