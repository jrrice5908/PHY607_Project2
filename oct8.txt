Project Concept: Simulating Brownian Motion with a 2d Random Walk
Plan:
	1)We will be simulating the Brownian motion of a single particle due to arbitrary kinetic energy of surrounding points (particles). 
	  Our simulation will take place on a 2D lattice, and we'll be tracking the evolution of a single particle's trajectory. 
	2)PseudoCode:
		We'll use a class ("Simplex") to initalize the lattic structure upon which our trajectory will evolve.
			We'll define 4 vertices as the corners of a "face," equivalent to 1 unit on the lattice.
			We'll use a method to return the nearest neighbor lattice points relative to current position, on of which will then be randomly chosen as next point of
			trajectory.
			Within this class, we'll define another class that will designate an arbitrary kinetic energy (within a reasonable range) for each lattic point.
			All particles will have equal mass.
			A markov chain will be used to impliment the concept of forces between particles, with evolution based on a 2nd order ODE of particles position. 
		We'll define another class ("Random Walk") that computes the simulation, the random walk of the particles trajectory
	3)Division of work: 
		Luis: Will work on Simplex class
	 	Julia: Will work on Random walk class -> will be using Dijkstra's Algorithm 
		*Each class will be contained in its own module*




Key results: we'll be looking at the particle's final position relative to initial position, with varied initial kinetic energies on lattice. 
We can measure how long it takes for the system to reach thermal equillibrium (avg KE evens out across lattice) by number of "steps" taken by designated particle. 

Class1) Simplex (the lattic itself)
Class2) Random Walk (Set of methods that executes the random walk)
